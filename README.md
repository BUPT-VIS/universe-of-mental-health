## Universe of Mental Health

Employees in tech companies are under enormous pressure due to their high intensity work. But many tech companies don't take mental health issues seriously. To remind tech companies to pay attention to the mental health of their employee, we visualized a questionnaire on the mental health of employees in tech companies conducted by [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/research/). 

Our work includes an overview of the universe and a detail view of the planets. The universe shows how employees feel about the company's tolerance for psychopaths, while the planet shows the company's benefits, counseling and other details. Here you are free to explore and listen to the story of each star on our website.

This work won the [2020 PacificVis Visual Data Storytelling Contest Winner Award](http://vis.tju.edu.cn/pvis2020/storytelling.html) in June 2020.
